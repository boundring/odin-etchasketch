## Etch-a-Sketch

This repository was created as part of my completion of Odin Project's Foundations course, JavaScript section 13, Project: Etch-a-Sketch.
Please see [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) for any particulars related to the project's instructions.

The project's page itself may be viewed at: [https://boundring.github.io/odin-etchasketch/](https://boundring.github.io/odin-etchasketch/).
